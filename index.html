    <h1 class="title">Investigation of anti-hepatocellular carcinoma agent, Chinese Herbal Medicine M1</h1>
    <h1 class="abstract">Abstract</h1>
    <p class="abstract">
        Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is one of higher malignant in cancers of human in the world. In addition, 
    HCC mortality rate for 20 years is the leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. The primary carcinogenic factors 
    includes hepatitis virus infection and other are caused by alcohol abuse, and ingestion of carcinogen such as aflatoxin, etc.
     HCC has the characteristics of high level metastasis, angiogenesis, and recurrence after surgery.
    
        In this study, we focused on how to effectively prevent metastasis and angiogenesis of HCC. Recently, it becomes important to use the Chinese Herbal
       Medicine (CHM) as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diseases. Here, we found that among 10 kinds of CHMs, 
       M1 could inhibit the cell migration at the dose less than half concentration of IC<sub>50</sub> (the half maximal inhibitory of 
       concentration). M1 significantly inhibited the expression of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
       , and downstream, Ras, ERK, and Snail. Furthermore, another downstream pathway protein, Protein Kinase B (AKT), mammalian target 
       of rapamycin (mTOR), Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-Œ±), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA) were also 
       inhibited. And the Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-9, which play an important role in metastasis 
       mechanism, were also inhibited by M1. Epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin, 
       were effective altered by M1 treatment.
     In the xenograft mice model, we observed the tumors growth sizes, weight, and protein
        expressions were effectively inhibited by M1. In conclusions, we demonstrate that M1 has an inhibitory effect to suppress 
        angiogenesis and metastasis of HCC in vitro and in vivo.</p>
    <p class="keyword">Key Word: Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Angiogenesis, Metastasis, EGFR, MMPs</p>

    <h1 class="intro">Introduction</h1>
    <h2 class="intro">1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        HCC has a high prevalence in Asia and North Africa because of the high frequency of chronic hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus 
        infections in these areas<sup>1-3</sup>. Furthermore, uptake of aflatoxin, alcohol abuse, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic disorders are also 
        the key risk factors<sup>1,3,4</sup>. The radical therapy is usually used to treat HCC in early-stage, but the occurrence and the metastasis cause 
        the poor prognosis<sup>2-5</sup>. In recent years, sorafenib is the first molecule drug to show clinical application for liver cancer<sup>2</sup>. 
        However, sorafenib has a count of restrictions, including the development of resistance and adverse effects<sup>6</sup>.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        Overexpression of EGFR is associated with liver cirrhosis and HCC<sup>7</sup>, and the high expression of EGER has been implicated in HCC-related 
        tumor metastasis and poor patient survival<sup>7-9</sup>. Furthermore, the activation of EGFR causes the activation of downstream effectors, such 
        as the Protein Kinase B (PKB, as known as AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and Rat sarcoma (Ras)/extracellular 
        signal‚Äìregulated kinases (Ras/ERK) pathway<sup>10,11</sup>. In clinical trials, gefitinib has been demonstrated discouraged results, so that the 
        investigations of effective inhibitors of EGFR have been emerged as the current trend<sup>8</sup>.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Angiogenesis</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGFs) play important roles in angiogenesis in cancers, and VEGF-A is a major member in VEGFs family that 
        binds to VEGF receptors of the cell membrane to stimulate downstream streams<sup>12-17</sup>. For example, the activation of downstream effectors 
        including AKT, mTOR, 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-Œ±), regulates angiogenesis, migration, and invasion 
        of tumor cells<sup>13,16,18-20</sup>. In addition, Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), have influences on matrix degradation, invasion, metastasis,
         and cause angiogenesis during tumor progression<sub>13,15,18</sub>. Therefore, VEGFs and MMPs could be the targets to reduce the
         angiogenesis<sup>13,19</sup>.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition (EMT) / Metastasis</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        EMT has been reported in various cancer progressions, such as tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis<sup>21-24</sup>. The features of EMT are the 
        disruption of intercellular contacts, matrix remodeling, invasion and migration through altering the cell-cell adhesion<sup>21,24,25</sup>. Ras/ERK 
        pathway is the main mediator arising migration of tumor cells through the suppression of E-cadherin, a calcium dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule 
        that plays a critical role in keeping epithelial cell feature, but the upregulation of N-cadherin, which is the marker of mesenchymal type cells
        <sup>21,22,24,26</sup>. Furthermore, the high expression of snail downregulates epithelial genes but activates mesenchymal genes to induce the 
        transformation of cell<sup>25</sup>. Similarly, MMPs also promote the metastasis process though degrading the ECM leading to the mesenchymal-type 
        cells migration<sup>21,23</sup>. Therefore, it is important to suppress metastasis by inhibiting EMT and MMPs to reach an effective anti-cancer 
        strategy.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Chinese Herbal Medicines (CHMs)</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        CHMs are known to mitigate clinical symptoms, prevent metastasis as well as recurrence, and delay progression of tumors<sup>27</sup>. For example,
         curcumin, the active principle of <u>Curcuma longa</u>, has multiple functions such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic activities 
         that inhibit the cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis<sup>28</sup>. <u>Songyou Yin</u> possesses anti-metastatic activity by inhibiting
          the expressions of MMP-2 and VEGFs<sup>29</sup>. Additionally, <u>Coptidis Rhizoma</u> inhibits tumor cell migration through reducing F-actin 
          polymerization<sup>30</sup>. Therefore, researches on CHMs toward cancer therapy have attracted much attention to develop as an alternative
           therapeutic strategy.
    </p>
    <h2>6. HCC Huh-7 cell line</h2>
    <p class="intro">
       <em> P53 </em> mutation is a carcinogenesis important factor<sup>31</sup>. Huh-7 cell line, a well-differential hepatocellular carcinoma, has a <em>P53</em> 
       gene mutation at codon 220 (A:T‚ÜíG:C) from a 57 years old male in Japan<sup>6</sup>. Huh-7 cells do not have virus DNA so that the virus interference 
       can be removed, and have been used for the liver cancer study<sup>6</sup>.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Research objectives of present investigation</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        In this study, we purposed to identify effective CHMs that could inhibit the liver tumor growth, such as migration, EMT, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
         Using IC<sub>50 MTT</sub>/ IC<sub>50 wound healing</sub> ratio, we selected the most effective one from 10 kinds of CHMs. <i>In vitro</i>, the liver 
         cancer proteins, EGFR and downstream pathways such as AKT and ERK signalings were determined. <i>In vivo</i>, mice xenograft models and the tumors marker 
         were examined to demonstrate the anti-cancer ability of CHM.
